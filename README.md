# Lynk Up World (LUW) - Open-Source Collaborative Care Platform

**LUW-Org** is a nonprofit organization dedicated to building an open-source platform that empowers families, caregivers, and communities to manage care for individuals affected by rare diseases, disabilities, and elder care. Our mission is to bridge gaps in care coordination and provide innovative, secure, and collaborative tools for those who need them the most.

## Our Platform
Our platform allows users to:
- Create and manage **detailed care profiles**.
- Collaborate in **real-time** with caregivers and family members.
- Use features such as **voting systems**, **secure document storage**, and **real-time notifications**.

## Why Open Source?
We believe in the power of community and collaboration. By adopting an open-source approach, we invite developers, caregivers, and advocates from around the world to join us in building innovative solutions that can make a global impact.

## Get Involved
We welcome contributions from developers, caregivers, and supporters of the rare disease and disability communities. Whether youâ€™re interested in improving the platform, adding new features, or helping with documentation, your contributions are valued.
